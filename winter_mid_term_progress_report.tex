\section{Purpose and Goals}
The STEM Academy program in Corvallis, Oregon, seeks to provide education in science, technology, engineering and math to the K-12 community through various programs, campus, and clubs.
They are self funded, relying on grants, donations and other sources, many of which require results-based data on the success of STEM Academy programs.
This data is collected from surveys that participants take while they are enrolled in one of STEM Academy's camps and other programs.
Currently, these surveys are administered on paper and the responses are tabulated by hand by volunteers.
This has not been an effective way of collecting current data to help secure funding and many of the surveys go untabulated.
The STEM Academy does have the ability to register participants online through Ideal Logic, but this is this does not help them with tabulating survey data.
They need a system which will allow them to electronically create surveys, a database to house all of the data from those surveys, and a report generation system so they can view the most current data in a timely and meaningful way.

A website which will allow the STEM Academy to create and distribute surveys, as well as view helpful data results, is the best solution.
The website should allow them to create questions that can be included across multiple surveys.
The questions should be able to be templated so that only one part of the question need change according to the topic of the survey.
Surveys should be able to be distributed via a web link or printed.
After a survey is taken, the data should be stored in a database according to the type of program.
This data should be queriable based on custom queries.
The user should be able to make a query based on the question and collected demographics as well as filter by program.
This service should be user friendly; the user should not need to know any SQL or other querying language in order to get data from the database.
After a query, the data should be able to be saved and added to a printable report so that it can actually be used in grant proposals and marketing material.
This website will be an all in one package for collecting and reporting on data in a timely fashion which is what the STEM Academy truly needs.
By the Engineering Expo, we will be able to present this website and show the full path of data collection, from creating the survey to querying to report generation.

\section{Weekly Summary}
\subsection{Week 1}
Over winter break Kyle set up a prototype of the database on his ONID account since we have not heard back from central services, so that our group would not lose momentum waiting on them.
He also studied AngularJS for the first week in order to be more useful to the group.
This week Shannon contacted Central Services since we had not heard back from them and the reason was that they had lost our ticket.
They told her that we can work on a LAMP stack and extend the pre-existing domain for the STEM Academy.
This would mean that the code would be done using php and mysql, but there is nothing inherently wrong with this
 For this week Javier worked on an alternative design for querying information since he thinks his previous design will not work.
The new design for a query consists of three drop downs for selecting a question, response, and an operator for a query which is similar to the one that Qualtrics uses.
He also studied Qualtrics to see what operators the tool uses for querying information and the flow on generating a result for a query.
Our group established a weekly meeting with our client for Tuesdays at 9:00 am.
The next step that our group will be taking is creating the website through Central Services. 

\subsection{Week 2}
This week Kyle created the initial setup of our web page and handed it off to Shannon and Javier to create their respective pages, starting with some basic templates and functionality.
The current state consists of mostly links going to empty pages.
Except for the survey page which is able to add text to the survey text, but it cannot save anything and do more than one question.
Central services contacted Shannon and told her that we can do the LAMP stack which is what our group is going to go with.
This week Javier wacthed another Angular 2 video and also started working on the query form page, but encountered a problem while trying to query the database for the camps to list on a drop down menu.
This week our group met up with our client for our first weekly meeting and we updated them on our plans moving forward and we also showed them the progress we made on the web pages.
Our groups goals for the upcoming week is to create a better HTML frame work, so that we can illustrate the flow of the program to the client. After this we will start working on functionality. 

\subsection{Week 3}
For week 3 Javier added some functionality to the report generation page which now allows a user to delete or add a query.
He also created the functionality that allows admins to login or logout of their accounts.
He plans on continuing adding more functionality to the report generation page for the upcoming week.
Some issues that he faced this week was that by not having the correct property value for the files it resulted in the files not functioning which took him a while to figure out.
This week Kyle updated the database to include a Camp table based on discussing the organization of the database and their needs with the client
 He also made other modifications to other tablese based on this change or demographic information that was missing.
For this weekend and early next week Kyle plans on getting code written to take JSON objects and convert that into a SQL query, as well as creating the code to take a SELECT query result and turn it into a useful (probably JSON) object.
This will help provide the basic functionality for interaction with the database from the rest of the service.
This week Shannon started implementing the functionality for adding questions to the survey.
Over the weekend she is going to continue working on this as well as implementing the preview survey.
In addition, she plans on calling Ideal Logic to figure out how to export the enrollments of studnets. 

\subsection{Week 4}
This week Kyle wrote the basic code for adding to the database and selecting from the database
 However, this is using hard-coded table entries due to Shannon working on the creation of the JSON object that he plans to parse from.
This week Javier fixed the add a camp page and an issue he encountered was that it was difficult debugging the problem that the page had.
The meeting with he client helped give Javier a better understanding of the queries that the client wants to be able to do, but is worried about coming up with a good design that will help meet their needs
For the upcoming week Javier plans on focusing more on report generation since this is the part of the project he is responsible for.
For this week Shannnon implemented the beginnings of the survey creation which is now able to generate questions dynamically and also create surveys.
In addition, she was able to construct the JSON object.
For the survey generation she still needs to implement saving a survey, edit pre-existing surveys, and have the ability to recall surveys.
She stills needs to contact Ideal Logic.
This week we met with our client to provide updates and to demo what we have.
Currently everything is going well for our capstone project. 

\subsection{Week 5}
This week our group met up with our client and they provided feedback on the report generation page design and during the meeting Shannon drew an alternative query structure based on their feedback.
Javier will have to make some changes to the report generation page, so that the client is able to do the queries that they requested.
Our client also emailed us a follow up about the things they want to be able to query along with examples.
This week Shannon contacted central services to get a sub domain.
Both Shannon and Kyle worked on getting the PHP working for posting a JSON object to the database table.
However, they ran into a problem where the POST data was coming back empty in the PHP code and were unable to find the issue causing it.
The plans that our group has for the upcoming week is to make revisions to our documents, create the progress report document, record the demo video, work on the capstone project, and to solve the issue with the POST data of a JSON object.

    \hline
     Positive & Delta & Action \\ \hline
  	Every assignment was completed & Our writing is not always concise and does not always accurately convey our ideas & To solve the writing issue we will consult more with the instructors and TAs as well as go to the writing lab \\\hline
	We have a solid understanding of our project & We had a really tough time with the IEEE formats & To solve the IEEE formatting issue, we will ask more questions in the future and take notes on the answer \\ \hline
	We have a good relationship with our client & We could still make sure to more frequently update our clients on our progress & We will make sure to have email or in-person communication once a week \\ \hline
	&We need to do a better job of scheduling and keeping to the schedule& To fix the scheduling we will start having a calendar on github which we can all monitor and stick to \\ \hline
