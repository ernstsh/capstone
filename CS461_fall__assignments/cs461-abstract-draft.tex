\noindent Abstract\\ \\
Securing funding for research is closely linked to establishing the problem through concrete data. Unfortunately for the STEM Academy in Corvallis, all of their data is housed through paper surveys, making it incredibly difficult and time consuming to glean meaningful information from the data. This can be deterimental to a program with limited resources trying to support students in the local community. This project sets out to develop a database and web service for the STEM Academy which will allow for the creation of surveys, collection and storage of results, visualization of results and generations of reports which will be to the standard of securing research funding.
