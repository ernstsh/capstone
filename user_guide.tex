\section{Introduction}
The following is a user guide for use of the STEM Academy Data Solution.
The STEM Academy Data Solution is accessible through the web site. % FILL IN HERE when on CWS
As a web application, there is no need for installation: the site will be fully accessible from any web browser. % We should TEST which ones, to be specific and safe. Firefox on my desktop doesn't work with the front page buttons, for example
There are two primary views to the web service: an admin view and a student view.
Each of these will be described in its own section, with the pages contained in each view further described in their own subsections.
The admin view is accessible by clicking the "Admin" button on the front page, while the student view is accessible by selecting the "Student" button on the front page.

\section{Admin View}
After clicking the button to enter the admin view, the first page seen is a login page.
Admins registered on the web service will be given a username and password for loging in.
Entering these and clicking "submit" will bring an admin to the main admin page if their username and password combination is successfully authorized.
Also on the login page are the "Reset" button, which clears the input fields, and an "Exit" button that returns the user to the front page.

\section{Student View}
After clicking the button to enter the student view, a student will be brought to a page with two drop down menus.
The first menu allows them to select their camp.
Only camps currently in session are listed.
After selecting their camp, the second drop down menu will list all of the students enrolled in the camp.
Students can click "Submit" after selecting their name to load the survey.
\subsection{Taking Surveys}

\section{Troubleshooting}
The following information is provided in case STEM Academy encounters a bug in using the STEM Academy Data Solution.
Unfortunately, software cannot be bug-free, but we hope the information provided in this section will help users recover from and resolve bugs that may impair use of the software.
