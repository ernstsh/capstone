\section{Specific Requirements}
\subsection{External Interface Requirements}
\subsubsection{User Interface}
The user interface will be a website. There are two views: administration and survey taker. 
The Administration view is for those creating surveys and analyzing data. They will input a 
username and password to gain access. They will then be navigating the site via mouse clicks 
and keyboard interaction. There will not be support for a touch screen interface. The survey
taker view is only for surveys. The survey will be distributed through a website link which 
will allow temporary access to that particular survey for the survey taker to take. The 
interaction will be via mouse clicks and keyboard. There will not be support for a touch screen
interface.

\subsection{Functional Requirements}

\subsubsection{Survey Generation}
\begin{itemize}
\item The software should be able to generate survey questions of a variety of styles.
	\begin{itemize}
	\item The software should generate questions with a matrix style of options.
	\item The software should generate questions with a multiple choice style of options.
	\item The software should generate questions with a text entry box.
	\end{itemize}
\item The sotware should also be able to organize questions.
	\begin{itemize}
	\item Questions should have display logic that can generate new questions based on the answer to previous question(s).
	\item Questions should also have display logic that can hide questions based on the answer to previous question(s).
	\end{itemize}
\item The survey should be saved and stored in a database location.
\item The survey should be editable at any point after it has been generated on the database.
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Survey Distribution}
\begin{itemize}
\item Outside user should be able to take a survey.
\item Surveys should be printable.
\item A survey web page should be able to be accessed using a compressed web link.
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Data Collection}
\begin{itemize}
\item The database should be able to receive and store survey responses.
\item Responses and data should be stored in the correct database hierarchy.
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Data Query}
\begin{itemize}
\item There should be a user interface (UI) that allows for performing SQL queries on the database.
	\begin{itemize}
	\item The queries should provide metrics for calculating the count, average, or sum of survey responses.
	\item Queries should be able to break out and display data particular to a demographic.
	\item Queries should be able to select from multiple tables.
	\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Report Generation}
\begin{itemize}
\item The software should be able to provide a printable report containing summary data.
\item The software should also be able to provide a printable report based on query output.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Performance Requirements}
\begin{itemize}
\item The web page should be up at least 99\% of the time.
\item 95\% of the database queries should take less than 2 seconds to generate a report.
\item The sytems should alllow for up to 30 users taking surveys simultaneously and storing 100\% of the responses correctly.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Design Constraints}
\begin{itemize}
\item The database will be constrained by the storage limits of the database system utilized.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Software System Attributes}
\begin{itemize}
\item The system be available to access 95\% of the time through the web page.
\item For security purposes, students' personal information should be encrypted.
\item The software should require ease of maintenance for a non-technical background so the clients have the ability to resolve any problems after we finish the project.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Other Requirements}

\section{Glossary}
\begin{itemize}
\item User - A person that will be interacting and using the product.
\item Query - Extracts information from the database based on the criteria that the user entered.
\item Database - A collection of information that is organized, so that it can be easy to modify and find information. 
\end{itemize}
