\subsection{Definitions}
\begin{itemize}
\item User - A person that will be interacting and using the product.
\item Query - Extracts information from the database based on the criteria that the user entered.
\item Database - A collection of information that is organized, so that it can be easy to modify and find information.

\subsection{External Interface Requirements}
\subsubsection{User Interface}
The user interface will be a website. There are two views: administration and survey taker. 
The Administration view is for those creating surveys and analyzing data. They will input a 
username and password to gain access. They will then be navigating the site via mouse clicks 
and keyboard interaction. There will not be support for a touch screen interface. The survey
taker view is only for surveys. The survey will be distributed through a website link which 
will allow temporary access to that particular survey for the survey taker to take. The 
interaction will be via mouse clicks and keyboard. There will not be support for a touch screen
interface.

\subsection{Functional Requirements}

\subsubsection{Survey Generation}
%\subsubsection{Overall}
Surveys should be able to be made from scratch and saved. Previously created surveys should be editable 
meaning questions should be able to be added/deleted, moved in ordering and the text of the question 
and answer options should be able to change. These surveys should also be able to be saved as well. 
Surveys may be deleted once created. A survey should be printable at anytime as well as publishable to a
web link which can be distributed. All surveys and questions will be saved to a database.
%\subsubsection{Structure and Formatting}
The user should be able to add questions to and delete questions from a survey. The questions should be able to
be reordered. The user should be able to add display logic to any question in the survey. Display logic means the
question will appear based on the answer of previous questions.
%\subsusection{Question}
There are three types of questions: matrix, multiple choice and text entry. Each question is comprised of the 
question text and the answer options text. The question text has the option of having a changeable subject
field where the everything about the question stay exactly the same except for the subject. Questions should
be savable and editable. \\

\subsubsection{Data Collection, Analysis and Report Generation}
A survey taker should be able to take a survey and the results stored to a database. The data should be queriable
via a user interface. Valid queries and subqueries include viewing data by: camp/club/program, student, demographic 
information, and questions. The results of these queries should be savable to a report which will allow titling and captioning 
of the data. The queries may result in raw data or summary data (averages, sums, counts, etc.) per the users specification 
in the user interface. These reports should be savable, editable and printable at all times. 


\subsection{Performance Requirements}
The web page should be up at least 99\% of the time. 95\% of the database queries should take less than 2 seconds 
to generate a report. The sytems should store 100\% of the responses correctly.

\subsection{Design Constraints}
The database will be constrained by the storage limits of the database system utilized.

\subsection{Software System Attributes}
 The system should be available to access 95\% of the time through the web page. For security purposes, 
students' personal information should be encrypted on the database side. The software should require ease of maintenance for a non-technical background so the clients have the ability to resolve any problems after the completion of the project.
